Steps:
- look up a series of communes in the DHS and see what are the parameters of getting political control through time
    ->  very unstructured, undoable in the same ways as population
    -> 2 ways to get it: from commune, or from lordship/seigneurerie
- get a map of the swiss municipalities with their properties listed
- create a rough datasets of political control through time

proposition:
- liste communes+anciennes communes in VD
- 


todo:
- DONE crosslink VD geometries with DHS entries for communes&anciennes communes
    -> DONE get all VD communes & anciennes communes
    -> DONE make a list of name of DHS communes vs list of geometries
        -> DONE make them both coherent
- DONE create communes' political entities
- DONE crawl all political entities from DHS to form basis
- create control links for every communes
    -> 1 file for communes PE, 1 file for higher-order PE
    -> look up communes' page
    -> move higher PE in hoPE file as needed
        -> consult their page as needed
